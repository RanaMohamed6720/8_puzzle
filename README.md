# 8-Puzzle Solver

A Python application that solves the 8-puzzle problem using various AI search algorithms and a Kivy-based graphical user interface (GUI). The project implements Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) and A* Search (with Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics) algorithms.

### About the Project
#### üîç Solving the classic 8-puzzle with AI search agents
This project implements a range of informed and uninformed search algorithms to tackle the 8-puzzle problem and bringing theoretical search methodologies to practical application in solving the 8-puzzle problem.

#### ‚ú® Interactive GUI
Engage with AI-driven puzzle-solving through an intuitive Kivy-based GUI. Shuffle the tiles, select an algorithm, and observe the solution unfold step-by-step.

#### üë• Solve it Yourself
The application also allows users to attempt solving the puzzle independently, moving tiles manually to explore different solution paths and strategies.

### Algorithms
The application implements the following search algorithms:

#### 1 - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
##### Description
A searching algorithm that explores all possible moves level-by-level until the solution is found (explores the shallowest first). Always guarantees the optimal and shortest solution path.
##### Pseudocode

##### Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(b<sup>d</sup>), Where b is the branching factor, and d is the depth of the solution.  <br>
- Space Complexity: O(b<sup>d</sup>) The algorithm must store all nodes at the current depth in the frontier, leading to high memory usage.<br>
- Completeness: <br>
  BFS is complete, it will always find a solution to a solvable puzzle.<br>
- Optimality:<br>
  BFS is optimal as it always finds the shortest path to the solution.

#### 2 - Depth-First Search (DFS)
##### Description
A searching algorithm that explores paths as deep as possible before backtracking.
##### Pseudocode

##### Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(b<sup>m</sup>), Where b is the branching factor, and m is the maximum depth reached. <br>
- Space Complexity: O(b.m)
- Completeness: <br>
 It is complete for this specific problem as the 8-puzzle problem has a finite state space with a maximum of 9! (362,880) possible configurations. This finite nature ensures that DFS will eventually reach the goal if the puzzle is solvable, thus making it complete.
- Optimality:<br>
  DFS is not optimal for the 8-puzzle since it can find a solution that is not the shortest path.

#### 3 - Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
##### Description
 IDS combines the space efficiency of Depth-First Search (DFS) with the completeness of Breadth-First Search (BFS). Since it systematically explores all depths and ensures that each level is fully explored before moving deeper.
##### Pseudocode

##### Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(b<sup>d</sup>), Where b is the branching factor, and d is the depth of the solution.  <br>
- Space Complexity: O(b.d), It requires memory proportional to the maximum depth being searched at any given time.<br>
- Completeness: <br>
  IDS is complete since it will eventually reach all nodes at depth ùëë and find a solution if the puzzle is solvable.<br>
- Optimality:<br>
  IDS is optimal as it will find the solution that is the closest to the initial state.

#### 4 - A* Search
##### Description
A heuristic-driven search that evaluates the puzzle state by estimating the cost to reach the solution:
- Manhattan Distance: Calculates the total moves required based on vertical/horizontal distance. <br>
- Euclidean Distance: Uses a straight-line distance metric between tiles and target positions.<br>
##### Pseudocode
![image](https://github.com/RanaMohamed6720/8_puzzle/blob/main/assets/a_star.png)
##### Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(b<sup>d</sup>), Where b is the branching factor, and d is the depth of the solution.  <br>
- Space Complexity: O(b<sup>d</sup>) A* stores all nodes in the frontier and explored sets, which can become very large.<br>
- Completeness: <br>
  A* is complete for the 8-puzzle problem because it explores all possible paths until it finds a solution.<br>
- Optimality:<br>
  A* is optimal as it will always find the least-cost solution.
